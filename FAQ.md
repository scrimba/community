## What is Scrimba?
Scrimba is a platform for creating *truly interactive* coding screencasts. A Scrimba screencast might look like a normal video at first sight, however it's something much better. As a viewer you can pause the screencasts and edit the code whenever you want.

## What are the benefits over normal videos?

Scrimba makes the learning experience **better** for the viewer and the creation process **easier** for the creator. Here are the specific benefits it has over normal videos:

- Easier and faster to create
- Interactive (edit/copy/run the code inside the screencast)
- Better mobile experience (content is adjusted to the screen size)
- Light weight (1% of video in bytes)
- Indexable/searchable

## How do I create a Scrimba screencast?
It's really easy. Check out [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDIlR71omg4&feature=youtu.be&t=1m49s), which explains it.

## Can I embed Scrimba screencasts?
Yes! Just wrap it in an iframe with the *src* attribute set to the URL of the cast.

## Can I edit a recording after I've created it?
Yes, check out the instructions for how to do that in the [docs.](https://github.com/scrimba/community/blob/master/DOCS.md#edit-recording)

## Which languages does Scrimba support?
At the moment, we only support client side code, meaning HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including external scripts/libraries) and Imba.

## How do I add external JavaScript libraries?
You can either use npm or link to CDN's via the <script> tags in the .html file. Check the [docs](https://github.com/scrimba/community/blob/master/DOCS.md#external-javascript-libraries) for instructions.

## Can I create playlists?
Yes! On your profile, click on your profile image in the top right corner and then *New Playlist*. Once created, you can add screencasts to it.

## Can I create paid courses on Scrimba?
Not yet, but you will in the future.

## Can I export my Scrimba screencast to a normal video?
We don't have a functionality for doing this yet. However, feel free to manually do a screen recording of your Scrimba screencasts, so that you can save them as video files locally.

## Why are you building Scrimba?
Our goal is to make online learning *better* than in-person learning. Here's why this is important:

As education has moved from in-person to online, the *in-person learning experience* has been reduced to a video with a comment field. This is a **big step backwards** for both the teacher and the student. 

Scrimba aims to re-create the *in-person learning experience* online, and even surpass it. This will ensure that everybody can get the same high quality learning experience you get through an in-person teacher.

We've also written [an article on why we're creating a new video format for code](https://medium.com/scrimba/why-were-creating-a-new-video-format-for-code-9f674f8dcc46) on Medium.
